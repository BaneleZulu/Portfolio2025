                        A landing page is an ideal web development project for beginners. It requires basic
                        knowledge of HTML and CSS. Through this project, you'll learn to create columns, divide
                        sections, arrange items, and add headers and footers. The most important aspect is
                        unleashing your creativity to design an impressive page. Pay attention to alignments,
                        padding, color palette, boxes, and other elements. Be mindful of CSS to avoid overlapping
                        elements. In short, a landing page project allows you to apply HTML and CSS skills,
                        encouraging your creativity while ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

                        Small project i did using Java Swing. This is the login UI which implemented some security check
                        mechanism
                        for password identification. The UI can indicate the strength of the password realtime.
