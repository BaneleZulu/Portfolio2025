                    statements. It also
                    introduces key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) such as classes, objects, inheritance,
                    and polymorphism. <br><br>

                    The course is structured into several modules, each focusing on different aspects of Java
                    programming. I learned how to
                    write simple Java programs, use Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), and work with Java's class
                    library. By the end of the
                    course, I was able to create basic Java applications and understand the benefits of using Java for
                    software development. <br>
